# Learn Any Programming Language – A Generic Framework

## The 12 Core Concepts

1. Types & values (numbers, strings, booleans, null/undefined, custom types)
2. Variables & scope (where data lives, lifetimes, shadowing)
3. Control flow (if/else, loops, pattern matching)
4. Functions (params/return, purity, first-class functions)
5. Data structures (arrays/lists, maps/dicts, sets, tuples)
6. Errors (exceptions vs result types, error propagation)
7. Modules (how code is organized and reused)
8. Concurrency (threads, async/await, event loop, actors)
9. Memory model (GC vs manual vs ownership/borrowing)
10. OOP / composition (classes, interfaces, traits, protos, composition patterns)
11. Generics / polymorphism (filesystem, network, environment, standard library)
12. I/O & runtime (filesystem, network, environment, standard library)
